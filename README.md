# Deep-Learning-NLP-Model-for-Next-Word-Prediction-using-LSTM-Networks
This project implements a deep learning NLP model using TensorFlow &amp; Keras to predict the next word in a text sequence based on the previous three words. The model is trained on Given novel dataset and leverages embedding layers and stacked LSTM networks for context-aware predictions.
