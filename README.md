# Deep-Learning-NLP-Model-for-Next-Word-Prediction-using-LSTM-Networks
This project implements a deep learning NLP model using TensorFlow &amp; Keras to predict the next word in a text sequence based on the previous three words. The model is trained on Given novel dataset and leverages embedding layers and stacked LSTM networks for context-aware predictions.

âœ¨ Features

Preprocessing and tokenization of raw text

Sequence generation with a fixed 3-word context window

Deep LSTM architecture with dense layers for accurate predictions

Model checkpointing for saving the best-performing model

Interactive CLI for real-time next-word prediction
